## Introduction
High Mountain Asia contains, apart from the polar regions, the largest glacierized areas and is therefore often called the "Third Pole" (Rowan et sl. 2018, Zhang et al. 2021).
Due to the size of the area and spatial heterogeneity within, different trends and patterns were observed, ranging from massive glacier decline in Nepal to an increase in glacier area in the Karakoram (coining the term "Karakoram Anomaly") (Nie et al. 2021, Bolch et al. 2012).
While some areas were and are studied extensively, other regions were less in the focus of scientific work, leaving broad knowledge gaps that need to be investigated. 
This study aims to analyze the behavior of glaciers in the Ladakh Range (India) and set it also in relation to the evolution and development of glacial lakes. 
The analysis was conducted using SAGA GIS. The used data was acquired from USGS Earth Explorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) and OpenTopography (https://opentopography.org).
